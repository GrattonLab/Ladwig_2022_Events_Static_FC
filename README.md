# Ladwig_2022_Events_Static_FC

Files associated with Ladwig et al. on relationship between high cofluctuation BOLD events and static FC.

Fig 1 (S1): Use discrete_generate_data.m to calculate coflux bins + network measures for each bin.

Fig 2 (S3): Use sim_generate.m to generate the simulated data + do the same analysis as Fig 1. 

Fig 3: Use simtoymodel_22.m to generate simulated data and do binned analysis for toy model. 

Fig 4 (S5, S7): Use sampling_comparison.m and sampling_comparison_iterate.m to compare sampling methods as in Fig 4. 

Fig S4: Use pca_real.m, pca_sim.m to find pattern in PC1. 

Fig S6: Use offset_analysis.m to do circularly shifting analysis.

matrix_thresholder and modularity_und are required helper functions.

Parcellated MSC Data used for these analyses can be found on our lab website (https://www.grattonlab.org/data_software).
